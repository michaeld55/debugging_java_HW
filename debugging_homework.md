Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
  To allow the code to pause and to use the debugger.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
  No.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
  Use step over to go to the next line in the file that you are in.

4. What does the step into command do?
  Goes into the next line of code that is ran by a method even if it's in a different file.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
  Evaluate expression just gives the result of one command. Code fragment creates a temporary Java instance of the code so you can manually run code and the gives you the result of that.
